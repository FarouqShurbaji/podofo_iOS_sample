podofo_iOS_sample
=================

sample integration of podofo pdf library in an iOS application. Example for annotating PDFs.

This is a sample iphone and ipad App that integrates the PoDoFo Library. It should work on both, simulator and device.
The iPhone version is not completed yet, but the iPad app should work fine.

Instructions:
Run the app and put some pdf in your shared documents folder (use iTunes for usage with device, 
for use with simulator you have to find the appropriate directory in the finder. Mostly /Users/"YourUser"/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.0/Applications/2035E398-683A-4EF2-8F1A-3F9DDCE6490A/Documents). When you open a pdf file you can 
see, add and delete FreeText and Square Annotations. To add the Annotation perform a long press on the position you 
want to add the Annotation.

This code can be used and changed however you want, as long as you rely on the licenses of the embedded libraries. 
Use it by your own risk.
